# Exponential Practice (1)

A simple exponential funciton has the following structure:

` y = A0 * e^(k*x)`

**Task:** You will write a program that helps the user practice modelling with exponential equations. The aim is to have a program that will generate a different data set each time for the user to model with an exponential equation. The user enters their values for the exponential model, and the program will check if they are close enough to the real values.
