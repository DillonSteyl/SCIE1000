# Context Based Exercises
A range of exercises to encourage students to use programming skills learnt across the semester to solve multi-step programming problems. Problems also require revision of concepts and problem solving techniques taught in class, which will help with exam preparation. Exercises are currently not allocated to particular weeks, but can be if necessary.
