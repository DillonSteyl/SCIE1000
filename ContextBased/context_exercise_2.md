Oscillatory motion is modelled using trigonometric period functions. The motion of a spring is considered oscillatory when it is displaced from its equilibrium position. For example, if we have a spring and attach a weight to the end of it so that the spring stretches, and then release it from this position, the position of the weight as a function of time can be modelled as a sinusoidal function. With friction present, this motion is damped and eventually ceases, however for this problem we will assume there is no friction such that the spring follows a simple sinusoidal model.

Suppose we have a spring that is stretched to 0.5m away from its equilibrium position due to the presence of a weight at the end of the spring. When released, the weight position oscillates with a period of 0.4 seconds. 

We want to write a program that will plot the position of the weight **away** from the equilibrium position (in metres) as a function of time, for 10 seconds. This will require the following steps:
1.	Create an array for the time you will use in the plot. Hint: A spacing of 0.01 seconds between time points is recommended so that your graph will appear smooth and continuous.
2.	Create a model to determine the position of the weight. Make use of the sinusoidal model discussed in class to do this. 
3.	Plot the position as a function of time. Give your graph a title, and labels for the axes that you think are appropriate. 

Write code to perform each of these steps as indicated below.
