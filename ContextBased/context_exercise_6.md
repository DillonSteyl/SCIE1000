Capacitors are a crucial electrical component that are used in the development of both micro-electronic products and large scale circuit development. To summarise briefly, they consist of two conductive metal plates, and store energy, similar to a battery. 

Between the two plates is a voltage difference. It is possible that the voltage difference across a capacitor is too high, and causes the component to rupture and fail. 

Suppose the voltage across a capacitor is given by
