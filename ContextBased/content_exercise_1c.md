# Context Exercise 1 - Part C
Finally, we now want to use this result obtained from implementing the trapezoidal rule over all the dye dilution method data to find the cardiac output of the patient, in the units of **litres per minute**. Write code in the designated area below to achieve this. Some hints for calculating this value are:
1. You require the area under the curve given from the trapezoidal rule. The variable 'area' in the code below gives this value.
2. Remember that the total dye injected into the patient's heart is 8mg.
3. Dimensional analysis is required. Note the units required for the output, and the units used for the dye dilution data (seconds for time and milligrams per litre for dye concentration).
