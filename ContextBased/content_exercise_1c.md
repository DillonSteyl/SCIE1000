# Context Exercise 1 - Part C
Finally, we now want to use this result obtained from implementing the trapezoidal rule over all the dye dilution method data to find the cardiac output of the patient, in the units of **litres per minute**. Write code in the designated area below to achieve this. Some hints for calculating this value are:
1. Remember that the total dye injected into the patient's heart is 8mg.
2. Dimensional analysis is required. Note the units required for the output, and the units used in the data. How can we obtain the result required?
