Supply and demand is a crucial concept covered in microeconomics. If an individual company wants to determine what quantity of goods they should be producing and for what price they should be selling the goods, both supply and demand need to be considered. In short, these two factors are governed by the following laws respectively:
The law of supply - Selling a larger quantity of goods at a higher price increases revenue. Therefore, the higher the price of a good, the higher the quantity that should be supplied. This law can be approximated using a linear model with a negative gradient.
The law of demand - If a good is sold at a higher price, less people will purchase the good, resulting in a lower demand. Therefore, the higher the price of a good, the lower the quantity that should be supplied. This law can be approximated using a linear model with a positive gradient. 
Note that these laws have the underlying assumption that other factors that could affect the supply and demand remain constant.
The two models will have an intersection point. This intersection point, known as the equilibrium point, is the ideal quantity and price for a particular good that will allow for optimal resource allocation, leading to satisfaction for both the supplying company and its customers.

Castlemaine Perkins, producer of quality beer XXXX Gold, has hired you as an analyst to determine the optimal price and quantity of XXXX Gold they need to supply for the upcoming State of Origin series. Suppose you have found the following models to estimate the supply and demand of cases of beer for the first origin game to be the following:
``` 
S = -0.1Q + 451
D = 0.2Q - 779 
```
Where S is the supply price, D is the demand price, and Q is the quantity of product produced.
In the event the Broncos win game one, you have predicted the demand price will increase by 6 units.
Write a program below which will determine the equilibrium quantity and price for both demands. Use ND as a variable for the new demand, if game one has been won by the Broncos. Your program should print the following messages to indicate the equilibrium quantities:
The equilibrium quantity for game one is *answer here* with a price of *answer here.*
The equilibrium quantity will be *answer here* if the Broncos win game one, with a price of *answer here.*
