You have been hired by the Republic of Madagascar to assist them in making decisions about infectious diseases. After learning about a new infectious disease, called Disease X, that has appeared in parts of Europe, you are worried that an outbreak could severely impact the country's population. 

Disease X has been shown to cause death for some people, and is highly infectious. You decide to run a quick simulation to see the impact a single infected person would cause. Here is everything you know about Madagascar and Disease X that will help you to run the simulation:

Infection rate (a): 2.5 per week
Recovery rate (b): 0.25 per week
Death rate (d): 0.01 per week
Total population of Madagascar (N): 25000000
Immune population (R): 0
Infected (I): 1
Susceptible (S): 24999999
Dead (D): 0

**Task:*** Use the initial values given to see the effect of a single infected person on the population of Madagascar, using an SIRD model. Use a while loop to calculate the changes in each of the groups over 12 weeks, with a step size of 0.1 week. Then, print the number of deaths and the maximum number of people affected at once. Plot a graph of the population over time, with all necessary labels.
