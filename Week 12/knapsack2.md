# Knapsack Problem 2

**Task:** Write a function called `best_item(V,W,space)` that takes as input a list of values `V`, a list of weights `W`, and the remaining space in the knapsack `space`. As output, the function should return the index of the item with the highest value per weight, that fits in the remaining space. If there is no item that fits in the remaining space, return -1. 

This might be a bit hard, so we have written some pseudocode for you (pseudocode is like code but written in words):

best_index = -1 # this is the index of the item with the
