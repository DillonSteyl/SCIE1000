Natural gas that enters the plant upstream is condensed, and then stored as LNG in tanks until a ship is ready to collect cargo. When natural gas is condensed to LNG, it will occupy a volume approximately 400 times smaller than it would have in its gaseous form. 

When the LNG is in the tanks, due to imperfections in the insulation, some LNG will become ‘boil-off gas’, and therefore needs to be recycled back through the plant to be condensed to liquid again.

Ships that carry LNG will also produce some boil-off gas during loading which also gets recycled back through the plant. Loading takes between 12 and 14 hours for a load of roughly 150,000m^3. 

Suppose you are part of the commercial team at an LNG company and you are trying to plan a weekly loading schedule at the plant. Your task is to write a program that models the volume of LNG present in the tanks across the weekly schedule. 

To undertake this task, note the following:
1. The facility has two LNG tanks with a capacity of 160,000m^3 each. For safety purposes, a combined volume above 300,000m^3 is undesirable.
