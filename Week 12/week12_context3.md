# Week 12 - Context Exercise 3 (INCOMPLETE)

Phase changes are typically represented using temperature. Taking water as an example, we know that water freezes at 0 degrees Celsius and boils at 100 degrees Celsius at sea level. At different elevations from sea level, freezing and boiling temperatures vary due to a change in the atmospheric pressure.

A pressure-temperature phase diagram shows how freezing and boiling points change with pressure for a given chemical substance. At a certain pressure and temperature, water can coexist in a gaseous, liquid and solid form all at once. This is known as the triple point. The triple point for water is established at a pressure of 0.006 atmosphere (atm) and a temperature of 0.0098 degrees Celsius. 

Your task is to create a pressure-temperature graph showing the triple point for water, and how the phase change boundaries vary with pressure.
