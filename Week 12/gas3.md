# Natural Gas (3)

Now that you have some handy functions, you are ready to write a function that tells you how much carbon dioxide will result from ethylene ignition.

Recall, the chemical equation for ethylene combustion is:

C2H4(g)+3O2(g)->2CO2(g)+2H2(l)

This tells us that for every mole of ethylene, two moles of carbon dioxide will be produced

**Task:** Write a function called ethyl_to_co(ethylene) that takes the volume of ethylene gas as input (cubic meters), and returns the volume of carbon dioxide gas (cubic meters). Copy paste your previously written functions to help you complete this task easily - they will be tested. 

**Hint:** You will need to convert ethylene gas in cubic meters to moles of ethylene, then calculate the moles of carbon dioxide, then convert moles of carbon dioxide into cubic meters of carbom dioxide gas.
