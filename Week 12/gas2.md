# Natural Gas (2)

Now that you have written a nice function that converts from cubic meters to moles, it is time to write a function that does the reverse!

**Task:** Write a function called `ideal_gas_V(n)` that takes the number of moles as input, and returns the volume of the gas in cubic meters. Again, you will need to rearrange the ideal gas law equation, which is repeated below for your use:

`PV = nRT`,

where `P` is the pressure of the gas (pascals), `V` is volume of the gas (cubic metres), `n` is the number of moles (mol), `R` is the ideal gas constant, and `T` is the absolute temperature of the gas (Kelvin). You can assume that `P`, `R`, and `T` will take on the following values:

```
P = 101325 Pa
R = 8.413 m^3 Pa K^-1 mol^-1
T = 298.15 K
```
