# Introduction

There is no more new python content after week 8, so for weeks 9 onwards the exercises will be focused on honing your skills, introducting new ways to use programming, and connecting with the lecture content. 

For this week, we will be introducing to you the concept of breaking down tough problems into smaller, more manageable problems. To do this in programming, the idea is that each small problem gets its own function. 

This way you can test each solution to the small problems easily, without having to run all your code. This makes it easier to find errors, read and write your code, and change your implementation without worrying about all your code at once. 

**Task:** Here's an easy one. Write a function called `negate` that takes a number as input, and returns that number multiplied by negative 1. 

# Solution

```
def negate(x):
    return(-x)

```
