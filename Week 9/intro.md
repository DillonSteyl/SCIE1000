# Introduction

There is no more new Python content after week 8, so for weeks 9 onwards the exercises will be focused on honing your skills, introducting new ways to use programming, and connecting with the lecture content. 

For this week, we will be introducing to you the concept of breaking down tough problems into smaller, more manageable problems. To do this in programming, the idea is that each small problem gets its own function. You start with writing the easy, smaller functions and check to see if they are working. Then you write functions that use those smaller functions. From that, you can build complicated programs with ease! 

By splitting your problems up into smaller sub problems, you can test each solution to the small problems easily, without having to write all your code in one go. This makes it easier to find errors, read and write your code, and change your implementation without worrying about all your code at once.

There are three different problems for you this week. You can do them in any order:

1. Alien Invasion. This is an easy problem that uses your knowledge of graphing and arrays to track the population of Earth after an alien invasion. This problem doesn't use functions, but does break the problem into two. 
2. Euler's Method. This is a moderately difficult problem that uses your knowledge of functions to approximate mathematical models. You learn to write the code for the general solution first, before applying it to a problem where you must track the trajectory of an asteroid.
3. Newton's Method. This is a difficult problem that works the same way as the Euler's Method problem, but it's a little harder. Newton's Method is used to find where particular values are reached by functions, which you will use in the context question to test if some capacitators can be used in an electrical circuit.    

**Task:** Here's an easy one. Write a function called `negate` that takes a number as input, and returns that number multiplied by negative 1.
