# Newtons Method (3)

**Task:** Write a function called `newtons_nsteps(x, n)` that applies newtons method `n` times given an initial guess `x`, and returns the guess after `n` steps. Remember to use your code from previous exercises. You are already rounding numbers in the outputs of other functions, so you do not need to do any more rounding.
