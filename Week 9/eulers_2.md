# Euler's Method (2)

Recall the formula for Euler's method is:

`next y = current y + f'(x)*h`

**Task:** Write a function called onestep(x, y, h) that calculates the next y value using Euler's method with the given x, y and h values. The derivative is the same as used in the previous exercise. Copy paste your function from the previous exercise and use it in your `onestep` function. 

Round the output to 5 decimal places. Do not print anything, call your onestep function, or ask for any input. You should have two functions defined in your code (onestep and fdash).
