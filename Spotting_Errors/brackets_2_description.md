# Spot the Error

Learning how to spot errors in your code is a very important part of learning to program. Even expert programmers make mistakes, whether they are typos or logical errors, and you need to be able to spot them quickly. The best way to learn is just to practice programming, because you will come across many errors that way. To give you a bit more practice, we have made some exercises that contain common errors, which you have to find! 

Note: Remember that different programming environments will sometimes give you different error outputs. So, an error in your code in MyPyTutor may look different to the same error in Jupyter. But they will always have the same solution!

**Task:** Find and fix the error in the following code.
