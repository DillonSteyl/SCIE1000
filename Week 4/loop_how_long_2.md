# Loops of Unknown Length

Remember in Introduction to Loops (4) where you added numbers together? In this exercise you will be multipling numbers together. When adding numbers together, you start with 0 and add the first number to it, then the second, and so on. But when you multiply numbers together, you start with 1 and multiply it with the first number, then the second number, and so on. Take a second to think about why. Remember this when writing the program!

**Task:** The user wants to multiply many numbers together. Write a program that will keep asking the user for numbers until they enter 0. When they enter 0, exit the loop (and don't multiply the number by 0!). Finally, print the final large number with the statement `print("The final answer is", number)`.

For example, if the user enters 2, 5, 4, then 0, the answer should be 40. You can calculate this by starting at 1, multiplying that by 2 to get 2. Then multiplying that by 5 to get 10. Then multiplying that by 4 to get 40. 

The input message has been provided for you.

**Hint:** You will need one variable to store the user's input, and another variable to keep track of your big multiplied number.
