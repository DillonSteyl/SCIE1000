# Introduction to Loops (3)

To get you more comfortable with while loops, let's try something different!

**Task:** Use a while loop to write a "Happy New Year!" program, which counts down from 3. Your output should be:
```python
3
2
1
Happy New Year!
```

**Hint:** As usual, you should define a variable that you can use to count through the loop. However, since you're counting *down*, you'll be subtracting from this variable instead of adding to it.
