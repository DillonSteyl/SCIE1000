### Input and Output

Variables are used to store data for later use in a program. For
example, the statement\
`word = 'cats'`\
assigns the string `'cats'` to the variable `word`.

We can then use the value stored in the variable in an expression. For
example,\
`sentence = 'I like ' + word + '!'`\
will assign the string `'I like cats!'` to the variable `sentence`.

When creating a variable, we can use any name we like, but it\'s better
to choose a name which makes clear the meaning of the value in the
variable.

The first two lines of the provided code will ask the user to input two
words, and will store them in variables `word1` and `word2`. Below that
is a call to the `print` function which outputs the value in a variable
`combined`. Write an assignment statement in the space between that adds
the strings `word1` and `word2`, and stores the result in the variable
`combined`.

For example, if the words `reap` and `pear` are input, the output should
be `reappear`.
