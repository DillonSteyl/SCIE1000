# Challenge: Solving Quadratics

For every week of MyPyTutor content, there is usually a challenge question at the end. As the name suggests, these challenge questions are meant to challenge you - they are not easy. The challenge questions are not intended to teach you any new content, so you are not missing out if you don't manage to solve them. 

Some of the best learning happens when you try to tackle a difficult problem, so make sure to give them a go. If you don't manage to solve it one day, try coming back to it after a couple of weeks. You should feel proud if you manage to solve even just a couple of them by the end of the semester. 

Since this is the first week, we will go easy on you -  so the question is only a little challenging. Good luck!

**Task:** Students in high school often have to find solutions to quadratic formulas many times, and it gets pretty tiring. You're at University now, so let's streamline this. For this exercise, you must write code that will find the two possible values of x that satisfy the following equation given a, b, and c:

``` 0 = a*x**2 + b*x + c ```

Ask the user for input and store the numbers as a, b, and c - in that order. Calculate and store the two values for x as x1 and x2. Print the answers at the end given the print statement we provide. 

**Note:** You may recall that sometimes there is no real solution for a quadratic formula. However, you can assume that we won't make your program solve a problem like that - so you don't need to think about it.

Try to complete this question without the hints first!

**Hint 1:** In case you have forgotten, your formulas should look like this, but using Python's operators.

x1 = (-b + (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)<sup>0.5</sup>)/(2a)

x2 = (-b - (b<sup>2</sup> - 4ac)<sup>0.5</sup>)/(2a)

**Hint 2:** Remember, you must use an asterisk (\*) between the variables and/or numbers you are multiplying, you can't leave it out like you can on paper!
