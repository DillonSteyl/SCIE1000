# Spot the Error

Learning how to spot and fix errors in your code - called 'debugging' - is a very important part of learning to program. Even expert programmers make mistakes, whether they are typos or logical errors, and you need to be able to spot them quickly. As you learn to program, you will become familiar with the different error messages you can get, and the bugs that can cause them. 

It's important to be aware that different programming environments will sometimes give you different error messages. So, an error message in MyPyTutor may look different in Jupyter (what we use in tutorials), but they should have the same solution.

Because of these differences in error messages, some environments are better for debugging than others. For example, MyPyTutor runs your code against a set of tests that we have written, and you don't actually get to see the output of your code or interact with it in any way. For that reason, debugging in MyPyTutor is very limited and you often have to rely only on reading your code and the output messages that are provided.

Environments like Jupyter are an improvement. In Jupyter you can run your code yourself, interact with it, read the output, and even write a bit of extra code after it has finished running. That way you can actually see how your code is behaving. If you installed Jupyter correctly, you should also have another environment called Spyder. Environments like Spyder go one step further and will point to issues and give you suggestions while you are writing your code, which can be very useful!

Jupyter is the environment that we use in tutorials, so we recommend that you use Jupyter to practice programming at home. However, it's not an issue if you would prefer to use a different environment at home - so long as you are programming in Python 3, not Python 2.

For MyPyTutor questions, you may find it useful to copy paste your code into your preferred environment if you get stuck. Then you can play around with the code, fix the problems quicker, and then copy paste it back into MyPyTutor to check your answer. 

To help you develop your debugging skills, we have included some "Spot the Error' questions. The error can be anything, such as incorrect syntax, a typo, or a logical error. The program may not even produce an error message when run in Jupyter - just the wrong answer. Regardless, the program wont behave as it is supposed to, and your task is investigate the error and fix it!

**Task:** Find and fix the error in the following code.

**Hint:** For syntax errors, the error message will tell you what line the program failed on - so the error occured either on that line, or just before it.
