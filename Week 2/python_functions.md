# Python Functions

Python includes some really useful mathematical functions, which take an input and produce some output. To use a function in Python, type the name of the function, followed by the input value you would like to use in brackets. Here is a short list of some examples of mathematical functions in Python:

```python
sqrt(value) # square root of value
sin(value) # sine of the value (value in radians)
exp(value) # e raised to the power of the value
log(value) # natural log
log10(value) # log (base 10)
```

Python also includes the `pi` constant, which approximates the value of mathematical pi.

**Task:** Write a program which prints the following values in order:
* The square root of 6
* e<sup>3</sup>
* The sine of 2 (radians)
* The natural log of 5

## Solution
```python
print( sqrt(6) )
print( exp(3) )
print( sin(2) )
print( log(5) )
```
