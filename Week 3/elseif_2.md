# Else If (2)

Here's another example that will let you practice using the `elif` statement.

**Task:** Modify this program so that it prints the following statements:
* "Don't be so negative!" if `number` is strictly *less* than 0
* "Glad to see you're feeling positive!" if `number` is strictly *greater* than 0
* "There's nothing here..." if `number` is exactly 0.
