# Introduction to Graphs - Multiple Functions and Customization

It can be useful to plot multiple functions at once for comparison or visualization purposes. To do this, we can simply use the `plot` function twice with two different arrays of y-coordinates.

```python
from pylab import *

# x-coordinates
X = arange(0, 2*pi, 0.1)
# function 1
Y1 = sin(X)
# function 2
Y2 = cos(X)

# plot:
plot(X,Y1)
plot(X,Y2)
show()

```

The output is given below.
