# Week 8

Week 8 covers plotting graphs - a lot needs to be rewritten.

Things to be covered:
1. Make a graph show up with a single point
3. Make a line show up
3. Make two lines show up
4. Make three lines show up with different step sizes (same equations for each but with a vertical shift so they're sufficiently distinct).
5. Draw a shape
6. Changing the linestyle, colour, linewidth, and marker. Should we refer to matplotlib for this? Learn how to learn, etc.
7. Adding titles and axis labels
8. grids and legends
9. Challenge question

Plus additional context exercises if you think of any.
