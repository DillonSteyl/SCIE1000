# Week 8

Week 8 covers plotting graphs - a lot needs to be rewritten due to reordering (we can actually make arrays now) and content that should be covered. A reminder that we CAN test for graph elements (titles, legends, labels, colours, data, you name it we can test for it) using the gca function. A good example of this is week 13 Disease X part 2 test.

Old exercises will be kept until we are sure if we don't need them. The graphs can be repurposed tho.

Write your name next to the topic if you are currently writing it or plan to very soon. Write DONE to the left of the topic if it has already been covered.

Things to be covered:
1. DONE - Make a graph show up with a single point (Discuss the plot function with three arguments (two single numbers and a marker), and the show function).
2. SASKIA - NEEDS TEST - Make a line show up (Discuss using arrays in the plot function)
3. SASKIA - NEEDS TEST - Make two lines show up with the same x array (Discuss using the plot function twice)
4. EMILY - Make three lines show up with different step sizes (same equations for each but with a vertical shift so they're sufficiently distinct).
5. Draw a shape (lines dont have to go left to right - gives them a slightly deeper understanding of whats going on with graphs).
6. SASKIA - NEEDS TEST- Changing the linestyle, colour, linewidth, and marker. Should we refer to matplotlib for this? Learn how to learn, etc. DOES THIS NEED TO BE SPLIT INTO SEPARATE EXERCISES?
7. SASKIA - NEEDS TEST AND EXERCISEAdding titles and axis labels
8. grids and legends
9. Challenge question
