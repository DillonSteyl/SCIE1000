# SCIE1000
This repository is for developing MyPyTutor Exercises for SCIE1000 in 2018.

Each folder above will contain a 'README' markdown file, which will summarise the content that should be covered in that week. We can also use the README file to discuss ideas, etc.

In addition, each folder will contain a number of .md files, each one representing a single exercise. You can include a python codeblock with to show what code will be available at the start of the exercise.

Alternatively, we could use .py files for the code if people think that might be easier - shouldn't make too much of a difference, you can always copy and paste the code from a code block anyway. :)
