# SCIE1000
This repository is for developing MyPyTutor Exercises for SCIE1000 in 2018.

Each folder above will contain a 'README' markdown file, which will summarise the content that is covered in that week, as well as the file order for upload.

Each exercise will have four associated files. The description file will end in .md, the attempt file will end in attempt.py, the test file will end in test.py, and the solution file will end in solution.py.



Exercises that have been updated for 2019:

Week 2: exercises 3-7

Week 3: andorchallenge, and, elseif

Week 5: context 2, loop 2

Week 6: Exercise 6.7 (Spot the error). Exercise 6.12 (second spot the error) all the way up to exercise 6.19 (code challenge).
