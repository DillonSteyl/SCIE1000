# Week 1
Week 1 consists of a *very* basic introduction, covering basic arithmetic and print statements. We could create some simple exercises,
asking for them to do some basic arithmetic and printing.

We should also use the week 1 exercises as an opportunity to explain how MyPyTutor works and get them used to the interface.
