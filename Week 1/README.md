# Week 1
Week 1 consists of a *very* basic introduction, covering basic arithmetic and print statements. We could create some simple exercises,
asking for them to do some basic arithmetic and printing.

We should use the week 1 exercises as an opportunity to explain how MyPyTutor works as well.

## Introduction
Welcome to MyPyTutor! Here, you can do some additional exercises to gain a better understanding of the programming component of this course. These exercises will involve writing and modifying programs to perform certain tasks. You will receive instant feedback from MyPyTutor, which will let you know whether your program is working as expected.
To get us started, modify this program, so that it also prints "SCIE1000 is great!" underneath the rest of the already printed statements.

```python

print("Hello World!")
print("Python is pretty sweet.")
# add your code here:

```
