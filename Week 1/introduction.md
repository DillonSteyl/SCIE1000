# Introduction
Welcome to MyPyTutor! Here, you can do some additional exercises to gain a better understanding of the programming component of this course. These exercises will involve writing and modifying programs to perform certain tasks. You will receive instant feedback from MyPyTutor, which will let you know whether your program is working as expected.
To get us started, modify this program so that it also prints "SCIE1000 will be great!" underneath the rest of the printed statements.

```python

print("Hello World!")
print("Python is pretty sweet.")
