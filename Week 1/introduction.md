# Introduction
Welcome to MyPyTutor! Here, you will be able to do some additional exercises to gain a better understanding of the programming component of this course. These exercises will involve writing and modifying programs to perform certain tasks. You will be able to receive instant feedback from MyPyTutor, which will let you know whether your program is working as expected.

To get us started, your first task is to modify this program so that it also prints "SCIE1000 will be great!" underneath the rest of the printed statements.

Once you are satisfied with your solution to the task, press the 'Run Code' button to test your solution. MyPyTutor will automatically check your solution, and provide instant feedback to you.

```python

print("Hello World!")
print("Python is pretty sweet.")
